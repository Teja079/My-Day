# MyDay — Pixel-Perfect Monday.com Clone (React + Node.js)


MyDay is a table-style task board inspired by Monday.com. I built it to match Monday’s **look, feel, and interactions** while adding a few unique twists and solid end-to-end quality: **realtime collaboration**, robust state management, and **Playwright** E2E coverage.

## Recent Updates

### 🔧 Task Menu Modal Fixes (Latest)
**Status:** ✅ Fully fixed — every menu action works as expected.

I resolved several critical context-menu bugs:
- **Delete Task** — fixed immutable updates so items are actually removed from their groups.
- **Duplicate Task** — stable cloning with clean IDs and consistent UI refresh.
- **Create New Item Below** — corrected array copying; insertion works in all groups.
- **Open Task Modal** — reliable navigation to the task details view.

**Under the hood**
- Adopted strict **immutable React state** patterns; removed hidden mutations.
- Improved error handling and state sync between table and details views.
- Added **Playwright** tests covering each menu action end-to-end.

### 🎯 Table Component Restoration
**Status:** ✅ Complete — table is fully operational.

Fixes include:
- **Component Picker** — resolved `UNKNOWN StatusPicker/MemberPicker/DatePicker` by normalizing registry names from **PascalCase → kebab-case**.
- **Dynamic Cell Rendering** — robust, data-driven cell components.
- **Drag & Drop** — stabilized **react-beautiful-dnd** and fixed `draggableId` issues.
- **Task ID Generation** — introduced reliable unique ID creation.

I also implemented **Magic Link authentication** alongside email/password login.

## Monday Description
Monday is a collaborative work manager built around boards: each **board** holds **groups** of **items/tasks** with columns like status, priority, owner, and due date. Users can rearrange everything with Drag & Drop, collaborate live, and track activity.

**MyDay** mirrors these core workflows—D&D, realtime updates, rich task editing, filters, members, and more—so you won’t feel a difference in day-to-day use.
